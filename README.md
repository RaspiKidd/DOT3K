Displayotron 3000

The template file is designed to make it easy to assign data to each of the joystic movements of the displayotron 3000
board, which you can find at www.pimoroni.com.

The DISPLAY_IP directory contains programs that I have used to display my IP address to make it easier for me to SSH in
to a network I have connected to previously.
